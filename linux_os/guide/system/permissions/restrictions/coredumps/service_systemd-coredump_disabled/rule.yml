title: 'Disable acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps'

description: |-
    The <tt>systemd-coredump.socket</tt> unit is a socket activation of
    the <tt>systemd-coredump@.service</tt> which processes core dumps.
    By masking the unit, core dump processing is disabled.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

severity: medium

platform: machine

ocil_clause: unit systemd-coredump.socket is not masked or running

ocil: |-
    To verify that acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps is disabled, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket</pre>
    The output should be similar to:
    <pre>‚óè systemd-coredump.socket
       Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit systemd-coredump.socket is masked.)
       Active: inactive (dead) ...
    </pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system to disable the systemd-coredump.socket with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl mask --now systemd-coredump.socket

    Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/systemd-coredump.socket -> /dev/null

    Reload the daemon for this change to take effect.

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must disable acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps.

template:
    name: service_disabled
    vars:
        servicename: systemd-coredump
        packagename: systemd

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is not configured to acquire, save, or process core dumps with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket

    systemd-coredump.socket
    Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit systemd-coredump.socket is masked.)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "systemd-coredump.socket" is loaded and not masked and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
