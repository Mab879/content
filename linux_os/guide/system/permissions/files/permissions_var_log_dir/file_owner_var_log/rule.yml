    Configure the owner of the directory "/var/log" to "root" by running the following command:

    $ sudo chown root /var/log

    The {{{ full_name }}} /var/log directory must be owned by root.

checktext: |-
    Verify the "/var/log" directory is owned by root with the following command:

    $ls -ld /var/log

    drwxr-xr-x. 16 root root 4096 July 11 11:34 /var/log

    If "/var/log" does not have an owner of "root", this is a finding.
