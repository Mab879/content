title: 'Uninstall tuned Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="tuned") }}}

rationale: |-
    <tt>tuned</tt> contains a daemon that tunes the system settings dynamically.
    It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically. Based
    on that information, components will then be put into lower or higher power savings
    modes to adapt to the current usage.

vuldiscussion: |-
    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).

    Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software, not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be disabled.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the tuned package is not installed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf list --installed tuned

    Error: No matching Packages to list

    If the tuned package is installed and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
