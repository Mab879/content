title: 'Configure SSH Client to Use FIPS 140-2 Validated Ciphers: openssh.config'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    OpenSSH is supported by system crypto policy, but the OpenSSH configuration may be
    set up incorrectly.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings for ciphers are configured correctly, ensure that
    <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</tt> contains the following
    line and is not commented out:
    <pre>Ciphers {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_approved_ciphers") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the OpenSSH client
    violate expectations, and makes system configuration more fragmented. By
    specifying a cipher list with the order of ciphers being in a “strongest to
    weakest” orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the
    strongest cipher for securing SSH connections.

ocil_clause: 'Crypto Policy for OpenSSH client is not configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSH client uses defined Cipher suite in the Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep -i ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</pre>
    and verify that the line matches:
    <pre>Ciphers {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_approved_ciphers") }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must implement DoD-approved encryption ciphers to protect the confidentiality of SSH client connections.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH client is configured to use only ciphers employing FIPS 140-3-approved algorithms with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config

    Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

    If the cipher entries in the "openssh.config" file have any ciphers other than "aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr", the order differs from the example above, they are missing, or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} SSH client to use only ciphers employing FIPS 140-3-approved algorithms by updating the "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config" file with the following line:

    Ciphers=aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.
