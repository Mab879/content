title: 'Install crypto-policies package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="crypto-policies") }}}

rationale: |-
    Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across an operating system and
    the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms
    undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data.

    Install the crypto-policies package (if the package is not already installed) with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf install crypto-policies

    {{{ full_name }}} must have the crypto-policies package installed.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Privileged access contains control and configuration information and is particularly sensitive, so additional protections are necessary. This is maintained by using cryptographic mechanisms such as encryption to protect confidentiality.

    Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.

    This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing "ping," "ls," "ipconfig," or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch).

    The operating system can meet this requirement through leveraging a cryptographic module.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} crypto-policies package is installed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf list --installed crypto-policies

    crypto-policies.noarch     20220223-1.git5203b41.el9_0.1

    If the crypto-policies package is not installed, this is a finding.
